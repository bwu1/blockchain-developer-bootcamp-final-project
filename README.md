# Project Idea: Crypto Donations Platform

- User donates crypto assets into Smart Contract on Ethereum
- Smart contract converts the donated crypto into stablecoins, which are allocated to the recipient charity
- Donation transaction is recorded on the blockchain with adequate information for tax reporting purposes
- Charity can withdraw accumulated donations into their wallets

Directory & File Location:
- Smart contracts, React components, and contract ABIs are all located inside the "src" folder
- There is extraneous code inside the project because I was working on this project before Consensys


To get started:

- Clone the Repo
- Execute "npm install" to install the node module dependencies
- Execute "npm run start" to load up the project locally on locahost:3000
- Execute "truffle test" to run the smart contract unit tests on a Ganache local testnet (port: 7545; network_id:5777)

 P.S. I was working on this project on my own to learned Solidity before I started the Consensys course, so thats why the UI is a bit more polished than normal
