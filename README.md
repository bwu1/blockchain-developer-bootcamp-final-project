# Project Idea: Crypto Donations Platform

- User donates crypto assets into Smart Contract on Ethereum
- Smart contract converts the donated crypto into stablecoins, which are allocated to the recipient charity
- Donation transaction is recorded on the blockchain with adequate information for tax reporting purposes
- Charity can withdraw accumulated donations into their wallets

To get started:

 - Clone the Repo
 - Run npm install to install the node module dependencies

 P.S. I was working on this project on my own to learned Solidity before I started the Consensys course, so it may look more polished/finished than the other projects that people submit
